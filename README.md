# Project: `Asteroid Game`

Language: Python 3
Library: Pygame
Description: This project implements a classic arcade game where players navigate a spaceship, shooting, splitting, and destroying asteroids while avoiding collisions.
Key Features:

## Stack: 
- `Python3`
- `pygame`
- `random`

## Gameplay:
-  Control a spaceship to avoid and destroy asteroids.
-  Shoot projectiles to break apart larger asteroids.
-  Handle asteroid splitting and spawning mechanics.
-  Implement collision detection between the spaceship and asteroids.

## Technical Implementation:
Utilize the Pygame library for game development, including graphics, sound, and input handling.
Employ object-oriented programming principles for game object representation (spaceship, asteroids, projectiles).
Implement game logic, such as movement, collisions, and scoring.


## Game development fundamentals.
-  Object-oriented programming concepts.
-  Working with the Pygame library.
-  Game design principles.

## Future improvements:
-  Add a scoring system
-  Implement multiple lives and respawning
-  Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
-  Add acceleration to the player movement
-  Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
-  Add a background image
-  Create different weapon types
-  Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
-  Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
-  Add a shield power-up
-  Add a speed power-up
-  Add bombs that can be dropped
